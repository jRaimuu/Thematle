### Game Objective
The objective of Codenames is to guide your team to identify all of your own team's secret words on the board while avoiding the words belonging to the opposing team and steering clear of the "bomb" word. The first team to correctly identify all their words wins the game.

### Game Rules
Pieces:

    A 5x5 grid of random words.
    Orange team cards, purple team cards, and neutral cards.
    Bomb card.
    
Setup:

    Cards will be shuffled randomly and placed on the 5x5 grid
    Each team selects a Decipherer and the remaining are agents
    Due to technology constraints, this is a **Pass and Play game**
    
Gameplay:

    The decipherers take turns giving one-word clues and a number to their team to guide them in guessing the words on the grid. The clue should be related to one or more of their team's words.

    The team members discuss and try to guess which words their decipherer is referring to. They can make as many guesses as the number provided by the decipherer plus one extra, but they must avoid guessing any words belonging to the opposing team or the bomb word.

    When a word is guessed, it is covered with the team's avatar card next to their scorecard (orange or purple, depending on the team). If a word is incorrectly guessed (belonging to the opposing team or the bomb word), it is covered with the opposing team's avatar card, and their turn ends immediately.

    If the team correctly guesses all of their words, they win the game. If they guess the bomb word, they lose instantly.

    Play alternates between the two teams until one of them wins or triggers the bomb.

Winning:
The first team to successfully identify all of their team's words on the grid wins the game. If a team uncovers the bomb word, the opposing team wins.
